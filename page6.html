                <p>Etta James was an American singer known for her powerful, soulful voice and her contributions to the genres of rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and jazz. Born on January 25, 1938, in Los Angeles, California, James began singing in her church choir and later began performing professionally in the 1950s.

                    Her career took off in the 1960s with hit songs like "At Last," "I'd Rather Go Blind," and "Tell Mama." Her powerful vocals and emotionally charged performances earned her the nickname "The Queen of Soul." James continued to record and perform throughout her career, receiving numerous awards and accolades, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
                    
                    In addition to her successful music career, James struggled with addiction and personal challenges throughout her life. She openly shared her struggles with her fans, and her music often reflected her personal experiences.
                    
                    James passed away on January 20, 2012, but her music and legacy continue to inspire and influence musicians today. Her contributions to the world of music have earned her a place as one of the most iconic and beloved singers of all time.
