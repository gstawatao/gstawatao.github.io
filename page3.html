                <p>Lauryn Hill's "Doo Wop (That Thing)" is a song that explores themes of love, relationships, and the pressures faced by women in society. Released in 1998 as the lead single from her debut solo album, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill," the song combines elements of hip-hop, R&B, and doo-wop music.

                    The lyrics of the song are divided into two parts, with the first half focusing on the pressures faced by young women in relationships. Hill warns against men who are only interested in physical relationships and advises women to prioritize their own self-respect and independence. She sings, "Girls, you know you'd better watch out/Some guys, some guys are only about/That thing, that thing, that thing." The chorus, which features a sample of the 1967 doo-wop song "Oh Girl" by The Chi-Lites, emphasizes the importance of respecting oneself in relationships.
                    
                    The second half of the song focuses on the pressures faced by men to be players and playboys. Hill encourages men to move beyond this mindset and to value genuine connections and commitment in their relationships. She sings, "Now don't you love me for me?/And not the things that I do?" Hill also emphasizes the importance of communication and honesty in relationships, singing, "On and on and on and on/My cipher keeps moving like a rolling stone."
                    
                    Overall, "Doo Wop (That Thing)" is a powerful commentary on the dynamics of relationships and the societal pressures that affect them. Hill's blend of hip-hop and doo-wop elements creates a unique sound that remains influential in contemporary music. <a href="page4.html" style="text-decoration-line: none;">>></a></p>
