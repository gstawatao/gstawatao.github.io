             <p>SWV (Sisters with Voices) is an American R&B vocal trio formed in 1989 in New York City. The group consists of Cheryl "Coko" Gamble, Tamara "Taj" Johnson-George, and Leanne "Lelee" Lyons.

                In 1992, SWV signed a recording contract with RCA Records and released their debut album, "It's About Time," in 1992. The album spawned several hit singles, including "Right Here," "I'm So into You," and "Weak," which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
                
                The group went on to release several more successful albums throughout the 1990s, including "New Beginning" and "Release Some Tension," which featured collaborations with hip-hop artists like Missy Elliott and P. Diddy.
                
                Despite their success, SWV faced internal conflicts and disbanded in 1998. However, the group reunited in 2005 and has continued to perform and release music, including their 2012 album "I Missed Us."
                
                SWV's music is known for its smooth harmonies and soulful vocals, with influences from gospel, R&B, and hip-hop music. The group's success in the 1990s helped pave the way for other female R&B groups and artists, and their music remains influential today.<a href="page5.html" style="text-decoration-line: none;">>></a></p>
